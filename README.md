# SHAPE-RECOGNITION-BY-IMAGE-PROCESSING-USING-MATLAB

The implementation of Shape Recognition using Image Processing involves the following steps:

1) Read the RGB (colored) image in from user.
2) Convert image from (RGB) colored to gray image.
3) Threshold the image (convert gray image to binary image).
4) Invert the binary image (in order to speed up the time of processing).
5) Find the boundaries concentrate.
6) Determine shapes properties (ratio of dimensions, roundness).
7) Classify shapes according to its properties.
